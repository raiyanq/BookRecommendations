# BookRecommendations

Book Recommendations is a pyspark script that will find book recommendations for users in the goodbooks-10k dataset(https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k). Note you need the ratings.csv file as well as the books.csv from that repository and I created a user who has only read "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" and gave it a 5 star rating to that repository. The script is based on an ALS demo script by Frank Kane in one of his courses (Taming Big Data with Apache Spark and Python - Hands On!). This script shows how features of Mllib such as ALS can be used effectively for collaborative filtering and predictive analysis in data science. 

Here is sample output for the script:
