# BookRecommendations

Book Recommendations is a pyspark script that will find book recommendations for users in the goodbooks-10k dataset(https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k). The script is based on an ALS demo script by Frank Kane in one of his courses (Taming Big Data with Apache Spark and Python - Hands On!). This script shows how features of Mllib such as ALS can be used effectively for predictive analysis in data science.
